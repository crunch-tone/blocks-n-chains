The goal was to create an application that will work without installing additional libraries.
The application allows you to create random colors rectangles, as well as links between them.

  2) Clicking the mouse with the Shift button pressed on the keyboard initializes the selection of the rectangle.
  3) Hold down the Shift key on the keyboard, you can click the mouse on all the rectangles.
     This will allow you to create or delete previously created links with the selected rectangle.
  4) Also, the highlighted rectangle can be deleted along with all its connections by pressing the “d” key on the keyboard.
  5) To drag the shapes, you need to click and hold a rectangle with the mouse. When you move, the created links are saved.
